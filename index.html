        <div class="card">The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), also known as the panda bear or simply panda, is a bear species endemic to China. It is characterised by its white coat with black patches around the eyes, ears, legs and shoulders. Its body is rotund; adult individuals weigh 100 to 115 kg (220 to 254 lb) and are typically 1.2 to 1.9 m (3 ft 11 in to 6 ft 3 in) long.</div>
        <div class="card2">As a result of farming, deforestation and infrastructural development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived. The wild population has increased again to 1,864 individuals as of March 2015. Since 2016, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In July 2021, Chinese authorities also classified the giant panda as vulnerable. It is a conservation-reliant species.</div>
        <div class="card3">The word panda was borrowed into English from French, but no conclusive explanation of the origin of the French word panda has been found.[3] The closest candidate is the Nepali word ponya, possibly referring to the adapted wrist bone of the red panda, which is native to Nepal. In many older sources, the name "panda" or "common panda" refers to the red panda (Ailurus fulgens),[4] which was described some 40 years earlier and over that period was the only animal known as a panda.</div>
        <div class="card4">For many decades, the precise taxonomic classification of the giant panda was under debate because it shares characteristics with both bears and raccoons.[11] In 1985, molecular studies indicated that the giant panda is a true bear, part of the family Ursidae.[12][13] These studies show it diverged about 19 million years ago from the common ancestor of the Ursidae;[14] it is the most basal member of this family and equidistant from all other extant bear species.</div>
        <div class="card5">The giant panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, limbs, shoulders and around the eyes. The rest of the animal's coat is white.[32] The bear's distinctive coloration appears to serve as camouflage in both winter and summer environments as they do not hibernate</div>
